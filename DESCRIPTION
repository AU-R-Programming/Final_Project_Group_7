Description: This package provides a set of functions designed to streamline the process of model training, testing, and prediction in R. It includes:
    - `train_test_sampling`: Provides functionality for partitioning datasets into training and test sets.
    - `lr`: A lightweight logistic linear regression function for quick model fitting.
    - `predict_test`: Facilitates prediction on a test dataset, allowing users to assess model performance.
    - `predict_new`: Generates predictions for new data using trained models.
    These tools make building, validating, and deploying logistic models straightforward and efficient.
